        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>
 I have no real experience on the web other than heavy browsing, I am optimistic on what I will learn and in which way I will do so. I first started up my virtual web server, I had some initial problems with entering my password as the letters were hidden. Once I had done this i made sure that all of the server updates were completed and then disconnected. I then filled out the introductory questionnaire. I will now this week do some further reading and expand some base knowledge on the subject.
        </p>
        <h2> Week Two </h2>
        This week I have been learning about HTML5 and how all web pages are made up from it. It is the underlying page of a website and is another lype of Language that I will be learning this year. I was taught in my lecture at how a HTML5 page is set up and how the different parts of the page have to be implemented so that the text or media will appear. One of the main features of the page is the title, this is the first thing that the user will see and can be chosen to be bold using specific tags. Other parts of the page include the body which is where the main part of the page is held and also the underlying tags such as HTML5 which is put in so that the page is identifiable and also the  language code, this is put in so that the computer knows what language the page is being created in.
        After continuing my private studies I had my practical session in which I made my virtual server and created my very first web page. I first had to download a chrome extension called Secure Shell which lets me connect to my own virtual server. I then had to follow instruction on a website and create my own virtual server. Once the server said it was running I was able to connect to it using Secure shell and ha to create my username and password. Once I had done this I downloaded a text editior called Atom and began writing a very basic web page.
        After configuring the settings and creating the folders required for the page I completed the HTML5 document and uploaded it to the server file using an external program from Microsoft. I was then able to load up my web page for the first time.

        I am very happy with how the week has gone as I have gone from not knowing too much about HTML5 and pages from being able to create my very own web page! Standard in which the page looks will be improved over the coming weeks and Months.
        <p>
  <h2> Week Three </h2>
  This week I have been learning styling techniques of HTML 5 and also css and how to link the style to a web page. We were shown in the lecture basic text on the web page, this by the end of the lecture was turned into the starting text of the Star Wars movies. This was done by using different styling techniques that can be used with HTML5. However we were told that although it is possible to use styling in HTML5 it isn’t a great idea as it makes the code look messy and soon takes up lots of space. We were told that there is an alternative to this which is the integration of a css style sheet. This type of sheet is a document that is saved in the web page folder and is simply liked to the HTML5 document using quotation marks.  The style can be changed in the css document and things that you can change include the background, text font and also the text colour. As well as the font location and margins. The styles make the web page look more formal and can be made into anything.
  During the practical lesson I was tasked on creating a css document and being able to add it to a webpage that was previously created. I was able to do this and was then able to play with different stylings and making the page look different. I also was able to add an image into my personal site by uploading the image to the folder and then quoting the image in the HTML document. I have also been reading the Mozilla website to further my knowledge on HTML and how it works. I am looking forward to playing more with my server and HTML and being able to add more and more things to my website.

        </p>
<h2> Week Four </h2>
This week my main focus has been on my upcoming literature review. This review is an 1000 word review on sustainable computing. This can be any topic to do with sustainable computing that I choose. I have to do some background research around the subject to see what I ultimately want to write about. I have done a small amount already and want to do something around the topic of Sustainable Computer Hardware. This is a really appealing topic to me as I really enjoy building computers and am fascinated by the hardware. I will continue doing research in the coming weeks about this to further my knowledge and also find some sources and topics that I can talk about in detail. I was also shown in my lecture how to successfully reference in detail. This will help me out as I had never referenced in such detail in previous education. This include the book's title, the year in which the book was published and also what page the quote is on.
I also continued on my HTML5 web page using my virtual server, I have successfully made more folders in the index and was also able to link a css file to the main Index. Now that this has been done this means that I don’t have to put styling into the original document as this can make the file look clogged and untidy. I also began the experiment with different styles for the page and want to make sure that the colours that I choose blend in well with the image that is on my main page.
I have been happy with my progress this week and feel as though I am progressing through this unit well. I am looking forward to the literature review as I feel as though it will test my literature and independent learning skills while furthering my knowledge in a topic that I enjoy.

I will now continue looking at sustainable computing and steadily build up some reliable sources that I can use with my review. this can be from books or journals however not from newspapers and news articles as they can be seen as being unreliable. Overall I am happy with how this unit is progressing.

        <p>
          <h2> Week Five </h2>
  This week I have been mainly focusing on my literature review, I have been mainly searching for sources that I feel will give me good information for my Literature review. I have been searching for sources in many different ways such as going to the Library and looking for physical books. I also have used the University's online searching tool that Allows me to look for Journals and pages much faster and also gives me the option to refine my search So I can remove types of Literature that i Don’t want to look at such as Newspaper articles.
  I have also been evaluating a mind map that was supplied in the Web foundation Moodle site which tells me how to identify good information and how to make a note of it so that I can go back to it in the future.

  So Far I have found many different sources that I believe can be of good use ranging in format. For example I have found a journal entry that supplies good statistics on the amount of Power used in the United States by Computers in 2014 compared to the Power used by Televisions in 2006. I feel as though these sources will most likely be included in my final Piece and I must now focus on retrieving the reference link for the articles.

  I also must look for more sources as I need to get a good understanding of the topic and also back up my own ideas with those of specialists. I can also look at their views in detail and compare them to mine.

  I have also been testing my understanding of HTML 5 by relooking at the previous work that I have done and also looking at further knowledge on it. I have also been playing with my Virtual Server and making sure that both my HTML 5 and also SQL can run correctly alongside each other.

  In conclusion I am happy with this week's progress and will continue to gather more sources for my Literature review that I shall begin drafting next week in order to be completed by mid November.

        <strong> Week 6 - Consolidation week. </strong>
        <h2> Week Seven </h2>
        <p>
         HTML Video and Continuing Literature Review
         This week my main task has been to continue looking at the features of HTML and CSS. The main things that I have been looking at this week are Images and Video and their behaviour in HTML. A good feature is that HTML 5 supports video in many different formats, the main formats that I have been using is MP4 and also OGG. I simply have to add a “control's” tag to my code and this enables the user to be able to Pause, change volume and also make the video full screen. I have also been able to make my Text all the same font and also centre all of the media in my Page which I feel gives it a more professional look. I have also been looking through the Internet at little extra things within HTML such as styling and also making my HTML and CSS look neater and less clustered.

         This week I have also been continuing on working on my Literature review. I have been gathering more sources online and evaluating whether or not they are good enough for my final Piece. I have also began drafting my Introduction in rough and also beginning to structure my piece as a whole. This includes a rough work count for each Paragraph and also specifics on what each Paragraph will be based on.

         Overall I am happy with how this week has progressing and am beginning to take a liking to Web Foundations as a whole. I am looking forward to continuing my Literature review and hope to add some hyperlinks to my Web Page next week.

        </p>
        <h2> Week Eight </h2>
        This Week I have been mainly focusing on my Literature review, this has included beginning on writing my final piece and constructing the writing around my sources. I have nearly finished the 1st and 2nd Theme as well as the Introduction, I am now deciding on my Final theme and gathering sources on it.

        I have finished my 1st paragraph on my first theme which is how Recyclable is a pc, this theme has been very interesting to cover as I have a passion for hardware components within a PC and how they all work correctly together. I have gathered many sources to do with the topic and feel as though I have good quality literature put together.

        I have also now finished my 2nd Paragraph on my second theme, this theme was based around how a PC can be made more recyclable. I gathered another healthy number of sources and feel as though the literature I have evaluated is to a good standard.

        I now need to finish my last them and then the conclusion, I am still curious on what my 3rd theme is going to be as I feel as my current 3rd theme is quite broad. Once I have found the theme that I want to do I feel as though I will be able to write the rest of my literature review with no issues.

        <p>
          <h2> Week Nine </h2>
          This week I have been looking at how Web pages are designed and what thought goes into the designing of web pages. We were given a worksheet with many different examples of web sites on them and asked to research what design went into them.

          This included many different things including:

          Purpose - What is the purpose of the web page and is it stated on the page?

          Target Audience - What is the Target Audience and is it clear on the web page?

          Aesthetics & Technicalities - What technicalities have been used when designing the web page and what emotional techniques have been used which can affect the user.

          This week has progressed well and I am looking forward to the next weeks work.

        </p>
        <h2> Week Ten </h2>
        This week I have been looking at HTML standards, these standards define how the HTML looks in its final form. There are many different standards that can be used and each of these have different functions.

        These Include :
        I , B , U , Strong and em

        Each of these standards has a different function for example ‘em’ is used to add emphasis onto words or whole sentences and would be specifically good for titles.

        We were asked to make a new HTML page with examples of all of the standards in. I managed to finish the task. I will now be looking at the next piece of coursework as I finished my Literature Review in time and feel as though it is up to a good standard.

        <p>
          <h2> Week Eleven </h2>

          This week I have been looking at text editors and customising them to suit me. We were shown the text editor called atom, this is what we were told to use as our main text editor as you are able to download different packages which can add new features that can maximise the efficiency in which you work at.

          We were shown a plug in called the multiple cursor addon which allows the user to add text in multiple places at the same time. This is useful for things such as tags in HTML as it speeds up the process of writing the tags. Next we were shown how to change the theme of the program which included the background colour, font and also the size of text. This is useful as everyone has their own personal preference on what they want their program to look like and this can lead to the user working more efficiently.

          After this we were asked to add the packages to our own version of atom and then use what we have learned to further better our website. I was able to add a navigation bar to my home page so that all of my work that is required for the coursework is able to be on their own separate page and not the same page, this will make it look cleaner overall.

          I then was able to search the web and find packages that I thought suited me, I was able to find a beautify package that allows atom to my my code look neater automatically and I then found a package that gives me a real time view of changes that I make to my html.

        <strong> Week 12 Christmas Break. </strong>
        <p>
          <h2> Week Thirteen </h2>

          This week we have been looking at scripting and how it works. Scripting is ultimately writing code that executes to complete a task. for example this week we were shown how to draw a stick figure with script. Scripting languages are usually interpreted rather than compiled meaning that it is usually translated and not created directly.

          We were shown this week how to add scripts to our code for our website, we were shown an example in which a stick figure would move to clicks. This is interesting as it isn't an individual program it is instead implemented into a web page.

          Scripting is a good thing to use on a website as it allows things such as animations to be added and also advanced things such as games. I am looking forward to learning more about scripting and implementing it in my own web page in the near future.
  <h2> Week Fourteen </h2>
  <p>
	This week we have been introduced to PHP, this is ultimately a scripting language that is used in HTML and web development. The difference between PHP and other languages such as Javascript is that PHP is run directly on the server, this means that the files are directly added to the server and don't take up that much room when compared.
	This also means that the client who is viewing the website will be able to see the script running, however they won't be able to see the code and won't be able to see how that It is working.
  </p>
  <h2> Week Fifteen </h2>
	<p>
	This week we have been looking at usability. This is ultimately how easy a Web Page is to use. There are many different things that can effect how easy a website is to use such as Fonts, Colours and Design. For example a Web page with small font which is all clustered together may be foudn to be difficult to use. We were shown many different web pages and how they each differ in design. The ultimate goal of this week has been to show us to make sure that our Websites for the coursework are easy to use. They should have been planned with a clear goal in sight.
	I feel as though my Website is easy to use as all features are clear to read and spaced out. I feel as though the colours don't clash and also that the overall page design is nice and easy to navigate. I am happy with this weeks work and am looking forward to next Week.
	</p>

  <h2> Week Sixteen </h2>
  <p>
    This week we have been looking at accesibility, this is ultimately how accesable a website is to use. This can be down to thing such as how a website copes when using different formats such as phones and tablets or weather a website can be used by the visually impaired.
    We took part in an exercise in the lab which made us wear special glasses so that we would see them same way the a visually imapired person would. We then looked at tools that websites can use to be available to use by the majority of people.

    I have also been continuing on my website, I have added the image and video now and also have added button that make the web page easilly accesible and easy to go to the other pages quickly.
